                    <h3>2. Description of Service</h3>
                    <p>We provide on-site mobile tire repair for passenger and light commercial vehicles. The Service may involve:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Inspecting and repairing a puncture (e.g., from nails or screws).</li>
                        <li>If the tire is unrepairable or at the Customer's insistence, swapping the damaged tire with the vehicle's spare tire (where available and accessible).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>A full service fee applies regardless of the outcome (repair or swap) once our technician is dispatched and performs an on-site inspection.</p>

                    <h3>3. Right to Refuse or Cancel Service</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We may, at our sole discretion, decline to repair a tire we deem unsafe or unrepairable.</li>
                        <li>We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason not prohibited by law.</li>
                        <li>We may cancel a service order for any reason, at any time, prior to or upon arrival.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Pre-Site Consultation:</strong> We may request photos of the tire/vehicle to provide preliminary advice. This does not constitute a final assessment. <strong>Only an in-person inspection at the site can confirm if we can perform the Service.</strong> We do not request personal information during initial inquiries.</li>
                        <li><strong>Outcome Uncertainty:</strong> Customers must assume all risk that we may not be able to fix the tire. Some situations (e.g., seized lug nuts, broken equipment, specialized wheel removal requirements) may prevent service, necessitating a tow or other equipment outside our offering.</li>
                        <li><strong>Customer Presence & Supervision:</strong> The Customer or their authorized representative <strong>must be physically present</strong> for the duration of the inspection and service. This is to secure the vehicle and belongings. Our technicians will only request access to the vehicle's interior/cargo area to retrieve or stow a spare tire, and this must be supervised directly by the Customer. We are not responsible for any loss, damage, or claims of loss to the vehicle or its contents.</li>
                        <li><strong>Vehicle Access & Safety:</strong> You are responsible for ensuring the vehicle is legally parked and accessible to our technician and electric bicycle ("eBike"). You must provide a safe working environment.</li>

                    <p>We offer a <strong>30-day warranty on the repair work itself</strong> against defects in workmanship or repair materials. This warranty is void if the tire fails due to new damage, pre-existing conditions, improper use, or driving on a flat. <strong>WE PROVIDE ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY OR GUARANTEE ON THE TIRE ITSELF, ITS CONDITION, OR ITS FUTURE PERFORMANCE AND SAFETY.</strong> The Customer assumes all risks of using a repaired tire.</p>
